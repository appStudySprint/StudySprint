    <p>Iâ€™m building StudySprint because I was tired of burnout. Of planning all day and doing nothing. Of having 1,000 tabs open and still not starting.<br/>
    This app doesnâ€™t yell at you. It grows with you. For every session you complete, you get visual proof that youâ€™re showing up. Thatâ€™s how habits are built.<br/>
    Iâ€™m still building StudySprint, and I hope youâ€™ll join me on this journey!</p>
